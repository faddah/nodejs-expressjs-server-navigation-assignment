# Node.JS The Complete Guide

## Section 5 — Working With Express.JS - Assignment: Express.JS - Second Exericse

My Solutions for the Second Coding Exercise in Section 5 of **[Node.JS — The Complete Guide by Maximillian Schwazrzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/)**.

This is an example of a single page app done with Node.JS & Express.JS.

In addition to seeing the name added in the Server `console.log(...)` output, it also adds it to the end of a text file, `userList.txt`. Note: after adding user names, if you wish to restore the text file to its original state, delete everything after the "**Spuds McKenzie**" line.

### To Launch

After cloning the repository locally, run it thus —

```
$ npm start
```

To see the app in action on your local machine, open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000).
